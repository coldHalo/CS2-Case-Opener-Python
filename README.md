# CS2 Case Opener - Python

Counter Strike 2 Case Opening Emulator made with Python. Some weapons are not included in the official Counter Strike 2 game, these are customs weapons I decided to add for some fun and better gameplay.

99% of this repo is vibe code. I used documentations when needed too.

To run the pyw file you will need PyGame installed on your system.

Patch Notes:

Pre-Release Patch Notes:

4/09/2025: Added basic printing for each case.

5/09/2025: Added UI, lots of bugs, open case function still works with both cases + inventory list stored.
